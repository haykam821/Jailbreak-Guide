This is a guide to the recently-released Unc0ver jailbreak.

## About Unc0Ver

Unc0ver is a jailbreak released by Pwn20wnd on October 13, 2018, which has many feature improvements over the previous [Electra jailbreak](https://github.com/coolstar/electra1131) by coolstar. It supports all iOS 11 versions with known exploits: 11.0 through 11.4 beta 3.

## Obtaining

You can find the source code of Unc0ver on [GitHub](https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus). It is licensed under MIT like this guide. You can build from source, or [download a pre-built version](https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff/Undecimus/raw/master/Resources/Undecimus.ipa).

## Improvements over other jailbreaks

In Unc0ver, Cydia has multiple new features ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/9nwxei/release_unc0ver_the_most_advanced_jailbreak_tool/)):

> * Native build of Cydia for iOS 11
> * Much faster Cydia
> * Much more stable Cydia
> * Much more modern looking and acting Cydia
> * Cydia skips uicache when not needed
> * Cydia supports iPhone X screen size

Testers have shared their experiences, which can be viewed [here](unc0ver-experiences).

## Switching from Electra

If you would like to switch from Electra, you only need to sideload the unc0ver IPA and run it. **However, this will erase your tweaks and sources, so you must back them up.** You can [use Flame to export tweaks and sources](flame-exporting-tweaks-sources).

After switching from Electra to unc0ver, do not readd the Electra-specific sources to Cydia. These must be manually deleted from Flame's exported source list. Adding them will require you to use Rollectra on your device!

## `/electra` on Device Jailbroken with Unc0ver

This is intended to maintain compatibility with tweaks originally developed for devices jailbroken with Electra ([source](https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd/status/1051354904571215873)). iCleaner is one of the tweaks that will break if this folder is removed.

## Common Errors
