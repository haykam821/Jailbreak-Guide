## GeoSn0w

As [a reply to the release post on r/jailbreak](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/9nwxei/release_unc0ver_the_most_advanced_jailbreak_tool/e7pmief/), GeoSn0w lists multiple advantages that unc0ver has:

> For those who are curious, I was a tester during the development and I have tested both the MPTCP and the VFS methods. The Jailbreak is reliable, has a better Cydia approved by saurik that will not conflict with saurik's versioning, it does not drain the battery, performs the necessary cleaning itself if you switch from Electra or other tools (so no Rollectra needed) and it has a ton of settings you can mess with for enabling / disabling tweaks, setting NONCEs, etc. It also sports the Cydia substrate.

In the same comment, he states that you should switch from Electra to unc0ver:

> Overall: Switch. It's well worth it from my testing, at least on iOS 11.3.x where I tested.
