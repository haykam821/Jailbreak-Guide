title: Exporting Tweaks and Sources with Flame
---

[Flame](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/com.aditkamath.flame/) adds extra customization and utilities to Cydia. One of these features is tweak/source exporting, which is useful when [switching jailbreaks](unc0ver-faq#switching-from-electra).

## Instructions

1. Open Cydia.
2. Choose the "Changes" tab.
3. Click the folder in the top-left corner.
4. Choose one of "Tweaks", "Sources", or "Both".
5. An email draft will appear.
6. You can now email yourself the list or copy the body to use elsewhere.

## Nothing Happens when Exporting

The tweak/source export feature requires the Mail app installed. You can reinstall it from the App Store.

## Missing Folder Icon

If you do not see a folder icon in the list, you must go into Flame's preferences in the Settings app and enable the feature.
